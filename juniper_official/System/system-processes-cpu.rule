/*
 * Detects Junos processes (daemons) CPU utilization threshold breaches and
 * notifies when anomalies are found.
 * Three inputs control detection
 * 
 *   1) process_name, is a regular expression that matches the daemons that you
 *      would like to monitor. By default it's '.*', which matches all daemons.
 *      Use something like 'rpd|dfwd|dcd' to match only rotuing, firewall and
 *      interface daemons.
 * 
 *   2) process_cpu_high_threshold, is the threshold that causes the rule to 
 *      report an anomaly. By default it's 80% of daemon CPU utilization. This
 *      rule will set a dashboard color to red when daemon CPU utilization
 *      exceed high threshold 'process_cpu_high_threshold' for period of
 *      3 minutes.
 * 
 *   3) process_cpu_low_threshold, is the threshold that causes the rule to 
 *      report an anomaly. By default it's 50% of daemon CPU utilization. This
 *      rule will set a dashboard color to yellow when daemon CPU utilization
 *      exceed low threshold 'process_cpu_low_threshold' for period of
 *      3 minutes. Otherwise color is set to green.
